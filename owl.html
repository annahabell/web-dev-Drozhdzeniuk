      <h2>What is a repaint and reflow of the webpage?</h2>
      <p>Repaint and reflow are two processes that occur when a webpage is rendered in a browser. 
        Repaint refers to the process of updating the visual appearance of an element, such as changing 
        its color or visibility. Reflow, on the other hand, is the process of recalculating the layout and positioning 
        of elements on the page due to changes in their size, position, or content. Both repaint and reflow are resource-intensive 
        operations and can negatively impact the performance of a webpage if they occur frequently.</p>

      <h2>How does JavaScript on the webpage affect page load speed and performance?</h2>
      <p>JavaScript can impact page load speed and performance in several ways. If JavaScript files 
        are large or not optimized, they can increase the page load time. Additionally, JavaScript 
        code that is executed during the page load can delay the rendering of the page, making it appear 
        slower to the user. Poorly written JavaScript code can also lead to inefficiencies, causing delays 
        in processing and responsiveness. It's important to optimize JavaScript code, load it asynchronously
        when possible, and minimize its impact on page load and performance.</p>

      <h2>What is "minification" of the script? Why is it useful to minify your scripts?</h2>
      <p>Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from a script, such as whitespace, 
        comments, and line breaks, without affecting its functionality. Minifying a script reduces its file size, 
        making it quicker to download and parse by browsers. The smaller file size also helps reduce bandwidth usage 
        and improves page load speed. Minification is useful because it can significantly reduce the size of JavaScript 
        files without sacrificing their functionality, resulting in faster page load times and better overall performance.</p>

        <h2>What is a JS Web Worker and when do we need it?</h2>
        <p>A JS Web Worker is a JavaScript feature that allows for concurrent execution of 
        scripts in the background, separate from the main browser thread. Web Workers enable 
        multitasking and help prevent JavaScript code from blocking the user interface, thus 
        improving the responsiveness of web applications. They are particularly useful when performing 
        computationally intensive tasks, such as complex calculations or data processing, without impacting 
        the user experience. Web Workers are commonly used in applications that require real-time updates, 
        heavy data manipulation, or long-running tasks.</p>
